# Stock_Growth_Analyzer
An Application that communicates with the IEXCloud API to show what could've been if you invested in the stock market at some particular date. It allows you to perform basic analysis of a stock or a whole portfolio, and compare it to a savings rate.

Savings Rate is defaulted to 8%, but changes in that will be rolling soon...


# Overall, there is a lot to improve and work on, so updates will be coming soon...
